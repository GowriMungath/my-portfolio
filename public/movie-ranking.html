<h1>The Best Movies According to Gowri</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Ye jawani hai deewani</h3>
<p>That one movie that makes you pack your bags, chase your dreams, fall in love with life and still crave the warmth of home and your people. Two perspectives, blended perfectly!</p>
<h3>Manichithrathazhu</h3>
<p>A timeless classic with vintage frames that mix horror, psychology, and drama so well. The stunning aesthetics and Shobana's old-school fashion are my absolute favourites.</p>
<h3>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</h3>
<p>The ultimate Bollywood love story that made us all believe in train romance, family drama, and "palat" magic. Raj and Simran will forever be goals.</p>
