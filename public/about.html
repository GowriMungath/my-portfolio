<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a lively soul who loves hopping around every shop, discovering new trends, all while keeping the traditional girl inside me alive.</p>
<p>Singing my heart out to 90s Bollywood hits and living life dramatically and unapologetically is just who I am.</p>

<h3>Things I Absolutely Love:</h3>

    <li>Wandering around and building a memory lane on Instagram! ðŸ¤³</li>
    <li>Old-school Bollywood songs on an endless loop ðŸŽ¶</li>
    <li>Striking 100 poses just for the perfect shot ðŸ“·</li>
    <li>F.R.I.E.N.D.S (Think Monica's personality with Rachel's fashion sense!)</li>
